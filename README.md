# Uploader+Thumbnail
A sample project I'm working on. We're talking about a couple of jQuery based, loosely coupled, javascript components.
The first takes care of file upload while the second displays the associated thumbnail.

Javascript files can be found in 'public/js/' folder.
Old browsers are supported via iframe fallback.

Still in construction...
