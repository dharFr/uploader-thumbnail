# Uploader+Thumbnail
A sample project I'm working on. We're talking about a couple of jQuery based, loosely coupled, javascript components.
A first takes care of file upload while a second displays the associated thumbnail and a third have to remove an already uploaded file.

Javascript files can be found in 'public/js/' folder.
Old browsers are supported via iframe fallback.
